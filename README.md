# A Patched Version Dwm By Jacob

> based on dwm6.2

## patches applied 
see the **patch** folder

## more patches 
visit suckless website

## keyshorts
read the **config.def.h** file 

## good notes when you applying patches
- bigger size patches first
- function related patches together
- make clean install every time you apply a new patch
- remember to move config.h before you make clean install
- be careful of **increase variables kind errors**, you do need to read the C code and modify manually
- errors and warnings tell a lot
